            <h3>Euro Truck Simulator 2 Modder</h3>
            <p>
                I began playing ETS 2 over a decade ago, initially unable to afford the game itself.
                I started to try mods since then.
                For years, Cheat Engine worked fine for get some extra money, but one day it stopped working.
                By that time, I had already purchased the game. Determined to find an alternative route to broke the
                game economy, I conceived the Stonks mod. Presently, it have over 200,000 subscribers.
